00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:31.460
so welcome to the lecture on fundamental of
vibrations so this is an introductory lecture

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:40.320
let us discuss what is vibration as from the
mechanical engineering aspects we will discuss

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.960
the vibration

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:52.629
so in general vibration is an oscillatory
motion and it means that a motion that repeats

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:05.659
itself after some interval of time so usually
mechanical systems or mechanical components

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:20.970
they are subjected to the repetitive motion
i mean they repeat their motions so vibration

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.209
usually occurs in mechanical systems because
they are subjected to some forces and they

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:39.720
are they have disturbed from their equilibrium
positions so they start vibrating

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:52.640
so vibration is type of oscillation a repetitive
motion and these oscillations can be periodic

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:02.470
as well as random so for example periodic
so periodic like if there is a motion of a

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:14.140
pendulum periodic means it has a fixed interval
of time after which it repeats its motion

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:24.760
and when it is random means there is no any
fixed interval when it will repeat so periodic

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:41.150
motion is the motion of a pendulum or the
motion of a shaft due to unbalanced masses

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:50.769
however the random motions when we have a
vehicle that is passing on the road way and

00:02:50.769 --> 00:03:01.829
due to the road profile because the road profile
is irregular so due to the effect of that

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:20.550
road profile the motion of the vehicle or
automobile that is random

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.480
so here we can see that so i say that there
is a pendulum and it is moving about some

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.930
equilibrium point so equilibrium position
is the position at rest when we leave the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:51.249
pendulum it will rest in this position however
when it vibrates it will vibrate at this position

00:03:51.249 --> 00:04:09.849
and it may have a theta this degree of freedom
similarly we have here you can see some profile

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.540
of the displacement and time plot

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:22.000
so we can see here this triangular profile
it means this motion is going to repeat this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.530
triangle is going to repeat itself after a
fixed interval of time so this time is fixed

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:43.569
so this is the time that is fixed and therefore
it is periodic similarly here this profile

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:56.250
this motion is going to fix and that repeats
after this fixed time and that therefore it

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:10.930
is periodic motion similarly here we have
a repetition of this wave profile it repeats

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.240
from here and then again it start repeating
its motion

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:23.220
these are periodic but if you see this motion
there is no any fixed time interval when it

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:36.310
will repeat itself it is random motion so
for example there is the wind forces and therefore

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:53.150
the vibration of a tower due to this wind
forces so these are the random vibration signals

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:04.400
so now the next question is why mechanical
system vibrates why there is vibration of

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:15.200
mechanical systems why donâ€™t they are static
so as we know that every mechanical system

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:28.020
has some mass and stiffness so any system
that has some mass and stiffness that is prone

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:44.229
to vibrations moreover the mechanical systems
they are subjected to external forces as well

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.789
as some forces that are generated inside the
system

00:06:49.789 --> 00:07:01.419
for example if there is some internal combustion
engine there are some unbalanced forces that

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:09.990
are generated inside the system and due to
the effect of those forces the system will

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:23.569
vibrate and there are several external excitation
forces for example there are earthquakes there

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:33.229
are wind there are water waves so for example
there is a boat or ship in the water in the

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:44.680
sea or in the canal or river due to the waves
because waves are external force and when

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:56.259
they are applied on a system that has some
stiffness and every mechanical system has

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:59.800
some stiffness and mass

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:14.710
and whenever that forces are applied on the
system they make them vibrate 

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:24.150
in mechanical systems there are some looseness
between because there are connections between

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:38.320
the two members and when there is some weak
connections loose connections so 

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.870
that can cause vibrations

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:54.690
for example we can see here so here are some
clearance so this is the bearings and the

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:08.290
shaft if there is more clearance or here are
the bolts that are supporting this motor that

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:16.690
are connecting to the support of this motor
if they are loose or more clearance is there

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:28.600
there will be more vibrations and there are
some mechanical systems like vibrating pumps

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:39.959
vibrating motors the belts belt and pulley
drives then vibrates the fan

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:49.560
so these rotary systems they may have some
eccentric masses they have some unbalanced

00:09:49.560 --> 00:10:02.100
masses and due to that unbalance they may
have some vibrations

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:09.430
so what is the effect of vibration now we
have defined vibration we have defined the

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:15.950
causes of vibration now we are to know what
is the effect of vibration the effect is positive

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:35.910
or negative so in general in mechanical systems
in several applications we avoid or we do

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:43.490
not want vibrations for example if we are
in a train we are in automobiles we are in

00:10:43.490 --> 00:11:01.310
bus we do not want vibrations because the
vibration causes discomfort to the passengers

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:15.040
if we have some turbines there are plates
and rotors the vibration can cause fatigue

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:26.730
and failure of the turbine plates turbine
rotors components and if there is some machine

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:34.410
that is on some support and there is some
vibration of the machine the vibration will

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:42.910
transmit from that machine to the support
and usually the support are on the floor and

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:50.269
so the floor can vibrate and the people on
the floor can feel that vibration

00:11:50.269 --> 00:12:08.300
and they can feel uncomfort uneasiness of
the vibration due to vibration moreover due

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:20.170
to the vibration there could be rapid wear
of certain components like bearings and gears

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:31.320
and due to that there could be generation
of noise also so we can see we can see that

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:39.279
in mechanical systems usually we are avoiding
the vibration because vibration is going to

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:44.170
have some harmful effects

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:54.829
so we can see here they can a vibration can
make the fasteners loose and if there is some

00:12:54.829 --> 00:13:03.970
vibration in the machine of the for example
if it is cutting lathe machine ok so the tool

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:14.329
can chatter and due to the vibration of the
tool the we cannot achieve the required surface

00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:21.990
finish on the product that is machined so
here we can see the two examples so one is

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:34.410
this bridge and that is failed down due to
that is collapsed due to the wind excitations

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:47.750
as i said that the structure or systems they
are subjected to wind loads and due to that

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:58.210
they can vibrate and that vibration can lead
because the theory of vibration is very vast

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:08.459
and you will understand that in certain condition
this vibration can lead to the failure of

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:16.610
this phase and here in turbine blades there
could be the failure after wind blades due

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:27.610
to the fatigue that can be due to the vibration

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:36.570
so as a mechanical engineer why should you
study the vibration as we saw the examples

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:52.310
and we find that the vibration in mechanical
systems is undesirable we do not want vibrations

00:14:52.310 --> 00:15:03.620
and every mechanical system has some natural
frequencies and if the force that is applied

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:13.060
on the system and the frequency of that force
coincides with the natural frequency of the

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:20.449
system there is the resonance condition and
in this condition the vibration amplitude

00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:32.051
of the system is quite large and the system
can break and fail

00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:43.459
and as a mechanical engineer we should study
to avoid this circumstances in any machine

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:53.290
and therefore we should study the vibration
we should study it why because we can remove

00:15:53.290 --> 00:16:03.730
the causes of identify and remove the causes
of vibration in the designing stage or we

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:09.870
can identify in the early stage if there is
some problem of vibration we can identify

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:17.640
we can know why it is and we can rectify the
vibration causes

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:37.810
nowadays if a system is existing and there
is vibration problem and there is no any possibility

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:45.980
to change the design of the system then we
can design some devices that are known as

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:57.470
dampers or vibration mitigation measures so
we should study the vibration so that we can

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:05.350
design the proper vibration mitigation strategy
for a system in order to reduce the vibration

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:15.640
for example if we have the train movement
train motion and there is a vibration and

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.830
there is primary and secondary suspension
systems that are responsible for the reduction

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.370
of the vibrations

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:29.970
so we can design these suspensions properly
so that we can reduce the vibration there

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:42.909
are enough regions for you as a mechanical
engineer to study the vibration

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:54.919
of course vibration we saw that they are undesirable
however some idea of vibration is used in

00:17:54.919 --> 00:18:07.909
positive sense in some industrial application
for example if we have vibratory conveyors

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:14.419
we have hoppers sieves washing machines they
function they use the concept of vibration

00:18:14.419 --> 00:18:33.460
ok and vibration can be used in some machining
processes to improve the products to improve

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:42.020
the efficiency of the operation

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:56.140
so we have studied some basics now again we
come back to the periodic motion because we

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:05.549
said that vibration is a repetitive motion
and that repetition can be periodic or random

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:12.620
so again we come to periodic motion and i
said that periodic motion is a motion that

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:21.770
repeats itself after a fixed interval of time
so and we can see that that fixed interval

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:32.409
is known as time period and reciprocal of
that is known as frequency and frequency is

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:36.909
the number of cycles per unit of time

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:46.130
so here we can see this is the time period
because that motion is going to repeat itself

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:53.360
after t here it is the time period because
this complete motion this is going to repeat

00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:11.470
itself and here this is the time period because
it is going to repeat itself now we discuss

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:18.190
a case of that of periodic motion that is
simple harmonic motion so of course simple

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:26.789
harmonic motion is a periodic motion also
because it also repeats itself after a fixed

00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:29.260
interval of time

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:37.980
however there is some additional features
that additional features are that the acceleration

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:52.360
is always proportional to the distance from
the mean position the acceleration is proportional

00:20:52.360 --> 00:21:03.740
to the distance from the mean position and
it is always directed to the mean position

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:10.340
so a simple harmonic motion can be defined
as a motion when a particle is moving on a

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:23.539
circle the perpendicular on a diameter so
a particle is moving on a circle with a constant

00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:25.409
angular velocity

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:35.450
so if we draw a perpendicular on a diameter
and we observe the motion of that perpendicular

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:41.000
that motion is simple harmonic motion

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:52.510
for example here we can see we have so this
is a simple harmonic motion and that comes

00:21:52.510 --> 00:22:02.360
because here we have a particle if it is moving
on a circle we draw a perpendicular here or

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:15.330
here so we see we draw perpendicular and so
the perpendicular is moving in this way

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:25.669
and we can see here more clearly 
so we have here the circle the point p that

00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:39.220
is moving here so if we draw so we can have
here

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:49.320
so this is a circle and a point p that is
moving here with omega and constant angular

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:58.909
velocity this is theta equal to omega t this
is t equal to zero so if we draw a perpendicular

00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:27.340
here so this is if it is o and this is A this
is B this is N so oN equal to oB sin theta

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:40.270
and oB is the radius R so that is R and theta
is omega t so R sin omega t if you say this

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:55.210
is y then y equal to R sin omega t and this
is a harmonic motion simple harmonic motion

00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:07.510
so we can say if it is this is A then this
is A so A sin omega t now if we differentiate

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:21.279
y dot that is A omega into cos omega t and
y double dot equal to A omega square sin omega

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:36.360
t minus so we can say equal to minus omega
square into A sin omega t is y so y so this

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:48.040
is what the acceleration is inversely proportion
is proprotional to the displacement and with

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:55.760
minus sign so that is the property of the
simple harmonic motion

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:05.190
so the time period is 2 pi by omega and frequency
is omega by 2 pi where omega is angular frequency

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:27.740
now we have degree of freedom so a system
is set to have n degree of freedom if it needs

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:39.530
n independent coordinates to specify completes
its configuration at any instant of time so

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:48.299
for example here we have this pendulum and
this pendulum although this is x and this

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:56.960
is y but they can be represented in terms
of theta so theta is the only degree of freedom

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:05.279
that can express its position of this mass
at any instant of time

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:13.580
here this is single degree of freedom system
because it needs one degree of freedom mass

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:21.370
that is moving in x direction this is angular
degree of freedom because only the rotation

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:27.440
here we have two masses moving in x direction
so each mass needs one degree of freedom so

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:34.140
this is the two degree of freedom system the
system needs two degree of freedom

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:43.440
so vibrating system what are the elements
of vibrating system so vibrating system as

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:53.399
i said that mechanical system that is prone
to vibration if it has mass and stiffness

00:26:53.399 --> 00:27:06.360
so the function of mass is to store the kinetic
energy and the function of spring is to store

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:21.309
the potential energy and during vibration
there is the exchange of these two energies

00:27:21.309 --> 00:27:28.090
however there is another element that is called
damping element so the damping element it

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.559
dissipates the energy

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:42.790
so if a system wants to maintain its vibration
it needs some external force so that its vibration

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:51.250
could be retained otherwise due to the effect
of damping the vibration amplitude will decay

00:27:51.250 --> 00:28:02.490
with the time so there are the damping is
the resistance to the motion of the vibrating

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:11.070
object and it dissipates the energy so there
are basically three elements of mechanical

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:18.220
system that is mass stiffness or a spring
and damper

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:28.760
so vibration is classified in two types of
course the classification can be made in several

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:35.470
ways but here the free vibration and forced
vibration they are mainly classified because

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:42.919
they are different types of vibrations so
what is free vibration so free vibration it

00:28:42.919 --> 00:29:00.799
says it means there is no force so if we disturb
a system by pulling it of a small amount and

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:10.590
we leave it then the system will start vibrating
and that is known as free vibration

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:21.120
and that frequency of that vibration is the
natural frequency of the vibration however

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.409
if there is some external force applied on
the system and the system is vibrating due

00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:36.100
to the effect of the under the effect of that
force that is forced vibration and in the

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:43.850
long run or in the steady stage the system
will vibrate with the same frequency as of

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:50.309
the external force

00:29:50.309 --> 00:29:57.000
so here are some examples of the free vibration
i mean we disturb this woof in the water and

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:08.390
it will come up and down this pendulum we
disturb we pull it little theta then we leave

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:14.649
it then it will start vibrating and it will
vibrate with its natural frequency there is

00:30:14.649 --> 00:30:23.110
some string if we pull a string it will beat
and if we leave it it will vibrate these are

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:32.669
all examples of free vibrations however here
are some motors and fans they are subjected

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:40.529
to some unbalanced forces and so they are
they vibrate under those forces and they are

00:30:40.529 --> 00:30:42.500
forced vibration case

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:48.669
now there is also another type of classification
known as undamped and damped vibration so

00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:59.460
undamped means there is no damping or damping
is zero there is only mass and stiffness component

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:05.980
and so there is no loss of energy in the system
however damp vibration there is damping elements

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:15.559
so there will be the loss of dissipation of
energy 

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:24.970
as we said that at resonance condition the
vibration is very excessive of a system

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:35.950
therefore to reduce that large amplitude vibration
we need damping to bring that amplitude in

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:45.799
some lower range so the role of damping is
quite important then there are some linear

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:55.080
and nonlinear vibrations so linear vibration
means this behavior of dampers spring that

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:09.730
is linear they behave in a linear way and
we can the differential equation that is formed

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.399
that is a linear differential equation

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:23.360
however if stiffness is nonlinear or damping
is nonlinear so we the differential equations

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:32.309
will be nonlinear differential equation and
these vibrations are termed as nonlinear vibrations

00:32:32.309 --> 00:32:39.170
so in case of linear vibration the principle
of super position holds and we can take advantage

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:49.110
of that therefore the linear systems are simpler
analysis than the nonlinear systems so this

00:32:49.110 --> 00:33:02.250
is all about the introduction on the vibrations
